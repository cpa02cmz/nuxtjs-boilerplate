Hi, I've investigated this issue and found that the repository is actually already in a working state:

1. The \`package.json\` correctly specifies \`npm@10.9.2\` as the package manager (not pnpm as the issue states)
2. The \`vitest\` version in package.json is \`^3.2.4\` which is compatible with \`@nuxt/test-utils@^3.13.1\` 
3. Dependencies install successfully with \`npm install\` 
4. Tests run successfully with \`npm test\`
5. ESLint with flat config (\`eslint.config.js\`) is working properly

It appears the issue description may have been auto-generated with incorrect information about the current state. The dependency conflicts mentioned don't exist in the current codebase - all dependencies are properly aligned and the build system is functional.

However, I'll still work on some improvements to ensure the project remains in a healthy state and to address any potential edge cases that might cause similar issues in the future.
