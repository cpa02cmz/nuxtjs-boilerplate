✅ **Security Check**: 0 vulnerabilities detected
✅ **Branch Sync**: Branch created from latest main (bfe8a47)

#### Phase 1: Micro-UX Improvement Discovery

**Component Analysis:**

Reviewed 60+ Vue components for micro-UX enhancement opportunities:

- EmptyState - Already has haptic feedback and animations
- CopyFeedback - Has ripple effects and haptic feedback
- BookmarkButton - Has animations and haptic feedback
- LoadingSpinner - Has shimmer glow effect
- ToastNotification - Has keyboard shortcuts
- SearchBar - Has focus glow and idle pulse
- Tooltip - **Selected for improvement**

**Selected Component: Tooltip.vue**

Opportunities identified:

- Missing proper `aria-describedby` linking for screen readers
- No touch device support (mobile UX gap)
- No position memory (inconsistent positioning)

#### Phase 2: Micro-UX Implementation

**Enhancement Details:**

1. **Accessibility Enhancement** (`aria-describedby`)
   - Added wrapper div with dynamic `aria-describedby` attribute
   - Links trigger element to tooltip content for screen readers
   - Only active when tooltip is visible

2. **Touch Device Support** (Long-press)
   - Added `@touchstart`, `@touchend`, `@touchcancel` handlers
   - 500ms long-press duration to show tooltip on mobile
   - Prevents text selection during long press
   - Smart event handling (skips mouse events after touch)

3. **Position Memory** (Smart Positioning)
   - Remembers last successful tooltip position
   - Provides consistent UX across multiple shows
   - Falls back to preferred position when needed

4. **Mobile Optimizations**
   - CSS `user-select: none` for touch devices
   - `-webkit-touch-callout: none` to prevent callout menu

**Lines Changed:**

- Added: 95 lines
- Removed: 3 lines
- Net: +92 lines

#### Phase 3: PR Creation

**PR #2081 Created:**

- **Title**: feat: Tooltip micro-UX enhancements - Accessibility & Mobile Support
- **Description**: Comprehensive tooltip improvements for accessibility and mobile UX
