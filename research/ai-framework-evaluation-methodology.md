# AI Framework Evaluation Methodology

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Performance Metrics**
   - Training speed (epochs per second)
   - Inference latency (ms per prediction)
   - Throughput (samples per second)

2. **Ease of Implementation**
   - API design intuitiveness
   - Documentation quality and completeness
   - Community support and ecosystem maturity

3. **Scalability**
   - Multi-GPU/distributed training support
   - Model parallelism capabilities
   - Horizontal scaling efficiency

4. **Resource Efficiency**
   - Memory footprint (VRAM/RAM usage)
   - Energy consumption (FLOPs/Watt)
   - Model size and optimization potential

## Benchmarking Process

1. Hardware standardization
2. Dataset selection (MNIST, CIFAR-10, custom dataset)
3. Model architecture parity
4. Training regimen consistency
5. Measurement protocols
