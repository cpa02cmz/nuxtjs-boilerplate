### Security Issues Analysis (9 new)

| Issue | Title                                   | Severity | Files Affected                                 | Consolidation Decision              |
| ----- | --------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| #3500 | Weak cryptographic configuration        | P4       | `configs/security.config.ts`                   | **Keep separate** - Config issue    |
| #3498 | CORS configuration uses wildcard        | P4       | `configs/security.config.ts`                   | **Keep separate** - Config issue    |
| #3497 | SQL injection risk via Prisma.raw       | P3       | `server/database/postgresql-adapter.ts`        | **Keep separate** - Database issue  |
| #3496 | Missing authentication on moderation    | P3       | `server/api/moderation/*.post.ts`              | **Keep separate** - API issue       |
| #3495 | XSS vulnerability via v-html            | P2       | `components/ResourceCard/ResourceCardBase.vue` | **Keep separate** - Frontend issue  |
| #3485 | Epic: PostgreSQL Adapter Critical Fixes | P1       | `server/database/postgresql-adapter.ts`        | **Already consolidated** (2 issues) |
| #3484 | Epic: Backend Security & Reliability    | P1       | `server/middleware/*`, `server/api/*`          | **Already consolidated** (4 issues) |

**Why Security Issues Stay Separate:**

Each security issue represents a distinct vulnerability class:

- **XSS** (#3495): Frontend component-specific
- **SQL Injection** (#3497): Database layer-specific
- **Auth Bypass** (#3496): API endpoint-specific
- **Config Issues** (#3498, #3500): Infrastructure-specific

Security vulnerabilities require individual attention and separate fixes to ensure proper remediation tracking.
