## Phase 2: Lighthouse Performance Audit

**Note**: Lighthouse audit is designed to run against a production build for accurate results.

To run full Lighthouse audit:

```bash
npm run build && npm run preview
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 npx playwright test tests/brocula/lighthouse-audit.test.ts
```

**Previous Lighthouse Results (Reference):**

| Category       | Score      | Threshold | Status  |
| -------------- | ---------- | --------- | ------- |
| Performance    | 63-64/100  | 60        | ✅ Pass |
| Accessibility  | 96-100/100 | 90        | ✅ Pass |
| Best Practices | 100/100    | 90        | ✅ Pass |
| SEO            | 100/100    | 90        | ✅ Pass |

> **Note**: Development mode scores are lower due to:
>
> - No asset minification
> - No text compression (gzip/brotli)
> - Source maps included
> - Vite client overhead

**Production Optimization Opportunities** (from previous audits):

| Opportunity                         | Potential Savings |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Enable text compression             | ~1480-1600ms      |
| Eliminate render-blocking resources | ~480-484ms        |
| Minify JavaScript                   | ~200-280ms        |
| Reduce unused CSS                   | ~230ms            |
| Minify CSS                          | ~120ms            |

> All optimizations are automatically applied during production builds (`npm run build`).
