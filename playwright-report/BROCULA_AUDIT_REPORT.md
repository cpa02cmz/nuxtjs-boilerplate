## Phase 2: Lighthouse Audit 📊

### Previous Scores (Development Mode)

| Category           | Score   | Threshold | Status               |
| ------------------ | ------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| **Performance**    | 38/100  | 60        | ⚠️ Below threshold\* |

| **SEO**            | 100/100 | 90        | ✅ Perfect           |

\* _Performance score is lower in development mode due to expected development artifacts (no minification, source maps, Vite HMR overhead)_

### Build Verification

- ✅ 162 PWA entries precached
- ✅ All routes prerendered successfully
- ✅ Bundle size: ~2429 KiB (acceptable)
